## Tools
- **VS Code**: For editing code

- **HTML**: For creating basic structure of the page
- **CSS**: For styling of static and dynamic content

## Summary
Through this project I made use of the module pattern as well as classes to create and manage projects. I also applied SOLID principles in order
to make code more scalable as the project details increased. If I were to redo this project I would have more of the dom modules with similar functionality
be merged together in order to edit the projects better.
